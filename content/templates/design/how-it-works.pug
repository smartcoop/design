                        h2 How it works - A participatory model
                        p This page describes the open design process for Smart’s design system. The design system is an ever-evolving system made by Smart and the community. Everyone is free to participate.
                        p The participatory model of open source for code is a well-known concept, but open design is quite new. In this section page we describe our open process.

                        h3 Getting editor access
                        p To keep some order, editor access is available once you’ve understood how we work, through an introductory meeting where the process is explained. In order to apply to participate, please email <a href="mailto:frontend@smart.coop">frontend@smart.coop</a>.
