            p You can find Smartâ€™s design files on Figma community, our profile is <a href="https://www.figma.com/@smartcoop">@smartcoop</a>. Follow us!

            p Community files exist mostly to show what the design system is all about in a public fashion. These are the individual links for the files:

                    a(href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1045654082538933026") Screens + Library v1.1

            p The design uses <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank">Inter</a> as its primary font. Inter is a font that is available in Figma by default, and you shouldn't need to install anything to use it.

            p Inter is a variable font family designed for computer screens by <a href="https://rsms.me/" target="_blank">Rasmus Andersson</a>. Inter is available in nine weights with matching italics, as well as a variable font version.

            p Should you need a desktop version, you can download Inter <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank">here</a>.
